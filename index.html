            <div class="head"><span class="headline hl3">When darkness overspreads my eyes</span><p><span class="headline hl4">by JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE</span></p></div>
            When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream;<p>and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the breath of that universal love which bears and sustains us, as it floats around us in an eternity of bliss; and then, my friend, when darkness overspreads my eyes, and heaven and earth seem to dwell in my soul and absorb its power, like the form of a beloved mistress, then I often think with longing, Oh, would I could describe these conceptions, could impress upon paper all that is living so full and warm within me, that it might be the mirror of my soul, as my soul is the mirror of the infinite God!</p></div>

            The sunset faded to twilight before anything further happened.  The crowd far away on the left, towards Woking, seemed to grow, and I heard now a faint murmur from it.  The little knot of people towards Chobham dispersed.  There was scarcely an intimation of movement from the pit.</p>

            <p>It was this, as much as anything, that gave people courage, and I suppose the new arrivals from Woking also helped to restore confidence.  At any rate, as the dusk came on a slow, intermittent movement upon the sand pits began, a movement that seemed to gather force as the stillness of the evening about the cylinder remained unbroken.  Vertical black figures in twos and threes would advance, stop, watch, and advance again, spreading out as they did so in a thin irregular crescent that promised to enclose the pit in its attenuated horns.  I, too, on my side began to move towards the pit.</p>

            <p>Then I saw some cabmen and others had walked boldly into the sand pits, and heard the clatter of hoofs and the gride of wheels.  I saw a lad trundling off the barrow of apples.  And then, within thirty yards of the pit, advancing from the direction of Horsell, I noted a little black knot of men, the foremost of whom was waving a white flag.</p>

Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base.</p>

            <p>Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. <span class="citation">"Don't under&shy;estimate the Force. I suggest you try it again, Luke."</span> This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home!</p>
            <p>You don't believe in the Force, do you? Partially, but it also obeys your commands. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. As you wish.</p></div>

STEFANI</span></p></div><p>The original banana of the United States, the Gros Michel banana, had become a stable in cuisine in the late 1800’s; its peel was extremely durable and its taste was sweet. The Gros Michel was widely considered “superior of all fruits”. However, since each banana was a genetic clone of itself, the species was extremely susceptible to disease. When the Panama disease struck in the Americas in the 1950’s banana companies searched for a suitable replacement. The Cavendish banana, our most common banana in US grocery stores, was chosen for its abundance. It was loathed by many proprietors, however, for its relatively fragile peel and bland taste. Banana companies learned that factors such as temperature, length of travel, the terrain of traveled roads, and the currents of ocean waters (tendency for damage), played a pivotal role in the Cavendish’s health when exported overseas. To lessen environmental influence, researchers and established fruit companies organized assembly lines, designed better shipment boxes, and built warehouses with gas-controlled rooms to maintain the ethylene concentration emitted by Cavendish bananas upon arrival. According to Don Koeppel, author of <i>Banana: The Fate of the Fruit that Changed the World</i>, Africa relies on bananas for nearly eighty percent (80%) of its daily caloric intake. The technological advances to accommodate the inadaptable Cavendish has influenced exporters to manipulate the ripening process of other fruits, and also vegetables, in the 21st century.</p></div>
        <div class="collumn"><div class="head"><span class="headline hl1">Earthquake liquefaction sinks millions </span><p><span class="headline hl4">by FU TURE</span></p></div><p>Liquefaction is an important destructive effect of earthquakes to urbanized areas in the San Francisco Bay Area. The phenomenon occurs when wet soil gains greater fluidity during and after earthquake shaking, causing the ground to shift freely. The unrestricted shifting patterns compromise the foundation of infrastructure. These damages can trigger underground pipeline explosions and surface fires amounting to millions of dollars in damages. The high magnitude earthquake can destabilize the economic activity of communities as well.</p>
					
					<p>During the 6.9-magnitude 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, San Francisco experienced catastrophe in its Marina District. Loma Prieta is a segment of the San Andreas fault that was relatively inactive since the 7.6-magnitude 1906 San Francisco earthquake, running from Santa Cruz County through the San Francisco Bay Area. The earthquake lasted for about 15 seconds, but its effects spread for months. Injuries and building damage left the region totally dismantled due in large part to liquefaction that occurred almost instantly.
To understand why the Marina District received the bulk of the damage, one must look at the restoration efforts following the 1906 earthquake. Earthquake-resistant technology was still in its early stages at this point. As a way to lower the cost of rebuilding, construction workers (under the collective advice of scientists and government officials) used the building debris as foundation for what is now the Marina District. The debris consisted of dirt, fragmented rock, and grounded old wood. These materials had the consistency of soil that would be easily warped with the water from San Francisco Bay to swallow whatever rested upon it.</p></div>
